From Frontend to Backend, from application layer to OS layer, I have built a map for various technologies, which helps me to learn new technologies very quickly.

When I was a frontend intern, I grasped React, EventLoop and built a Functional Programming mindset, which help me a lot when comes into Java NIO and Java Stream API. I also built a strong OOP mindset after I programmed in Java for a year and a half.

Having a FP and OOP mindset, plus a good understanding of EventLoop, Python is really easy and fun to master. I love decorator and coroutine in Python.

I am the tech guy who is willing to dive into the foundation of various technologies. Currently, I am obsessed with learning xv6 operating system and TCP/IP networking stack.

我的成长历程,是从前端到后端,从上层到底层的,建立了一个技术体系框架。实习从前端开始,
掌握了 React, EventLoop 和函数式编程思想之后,考虑到自己没有美感,又想实践 OOP, 就做了一
年半的 Java 后端。熟悉了 Java 和 JVM 的同时,接触到了 Kubernetes, 重燃了对计算机网络和操作
系统的兴趣,目前正在研究 xv6 操作系统实现和一个简单的用户态 TCP/IP 栈。
